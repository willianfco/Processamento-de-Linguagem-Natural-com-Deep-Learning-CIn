This game seems to have the potential to become one of the most exciting games to ever grace the game. Killers are far more likely to get hit while trying to leave a window or escape a falling head-on. A few survivors have escaped at great speed and were able to escape in just seconds while waiting for the hatch to open. Killers can use hooks to open hatch, and hooks are usually required to start the hatch with the survivor.\n",
      "The main issue with this game is most survivors aren't being matched against either killer. The killer can have almost all survivors against same killer, and all of them die while matching. The only survivor who still gets matched against both Killer are those with all 30 hours left for matching. There is no matchmaking or matchmaking, and most of the matchmaking itself is really broken. There are no matchmaking systems, no matchmaking system\n"

Unfortunately it has nothing to do with the killer playing. Most survivors are forced by a hook to be camped. Every killer that has these hooks and hooks has been caught for no reason whatsoever. Nowhere is this thought of more than when you have a hook of the killer you can see his head on the monitor that the killer is playing in. That is where you notice he is lying on the monitor waiting for you to get caught. Nowhere is this thought to be more than when you see him sitting on a hook. If you notice the killer is crouching there you can see that he is actually lying on the monitor for you to catch the hook. Also there is a disconnect problem.\n",

While I have fun while and fun at times you can find stuff and stuff at it just the price of $20, there's a lot of ways in and around the grind of this game.

It has itself to many issues that have come up in the community over over the past 3 years, and it has the potential of an active community of both sides.

So many survivors, killer perks, and killers are available that you can level up to level up with unique perks. After you level up in this game you will get many of the base perks and new killers, maps. The base system is pretty broken and is extremely inconsistent. Bugs are rampant with the developers.  This game has potential but has only gone downhill.  The community has been in this game for a while. What is the most recent update, most recent update has been broken has been broken and over powered by the devs? The game has become less of an online game and now a completely broken game system. There are no other game options with non-existent perk system for killers, and the developers don't care to address the problems of the survivor or killer gameplay.\n",

The only point in this game is that there are so many perks that nobody has ever played in the game. But even that they can be used in the game. Now that they've done this, they have managed to destroy a game with no success, they had no idea how to play the game. You'll be able to see that with any of you, but with every update there are no signs of getting better or being worse. The developers don't care about balance and it's in an incredibly bad state that it's becoming a nightmare. \n",

I like the asymmetrical survival aspect of the game and the fun concept of it is a bit like a game in which there can be no skill based match. In the current state, the game does not have much balancing to offer. It's all about the game's design, not the mechanics behind the game, and rather the design. The most recent changes to this is for \"fixing\" players, which is basically unplayable. I mean not too bad. This changes to say \"cheating\" matches with a survivor team (only once) where the killer literally has to camp the survivors to get enough points and kill the others. This issue just needs a bit of balancing, but the meta doesn't seem to improve the way we play. There is also an ability where\n"

      "I've been playing it for quite a few years now and I can't say more than a thousand times that I have been able to have fun in it. It was my favourite experience to have with other friends, but it has never been that true.  The game is now incredibly grindy and just not fun and at the same time you cant do much without skill and a lack of patience.  The devs are completely incompetent and completely broken, because at first the game was very easy to play and the killers were easy to find. But since I played it for about a few weeks now and i got put in a lot of fun for the new maps, there is no fun. Also killers are basically unplayable against against survivors and there is no fun\n"

The way this game works, as well as the community, makes it difficult for any survivor to be fun to play and make it easy to learn, as long as you are skilled enough to understand how to play the game, you'll get your teammates to be fun and have fun trying and playing as killer, which is really annoying if you're playing against the killers.

It was a lot of fun back then and now there is a lot of \"playable games\" that the developers are just making it through. There are other games that have been around the game for a while, and all have been fixed.

The new killers have become more and more powerful. I want to play games with the perk for now and im really not sure what killers are doing with this game. In general the survivors only have one perk vs 4 perks, so it's all the same when I find my items used on both sides and no perk is actually useful at all. There has been so much change from what I originally purchased, to what I feel now is it, and its done. Overall its fun, very well written. Not recommended\n"

I really appreciate all of the different ways you can play and the different ways you can play. It's just sad to see it get any better and you'll regret it all the time. If you've ever had an issue with matchmaking, it is your fault you don't have to wait for an hour for a game, you'll have people get matched with so much higher and higher ranks that they will actually have fun. I think we should keep the system up, so you can learn how to play better. The issue is the constant bug-making. The developers are also pretty incompetent at their game and the lack of good devs keep pushing out more and more\n"
