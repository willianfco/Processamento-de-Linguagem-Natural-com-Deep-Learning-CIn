# NLP Project - Analysis of Dead by Daylight Game Reviews

Authors: Julierme Silva and Willian Oliveira

This project is part of the Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning course in the Deep Learning specialization at CIn-UFPE and aims to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the reviews of the Dead by Daylight game available on the Steam platform.

## Objectives

1. Collect all English reviews of the Dead by Daylight game on the Steam platform using the Steam review API.
2. Perform preprocessing and data cleaning.
3. Apply NLP techniques to extract insights and patterns from the data.
4. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Requests
- NLP Libraries (NLTK, SpaCy, etc.)
- Deep Learning Libraries (TensorFlow 2.x)

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Data Collection

The `Get_Reviews.ipynb` script collects all English reviews of the Dead by Daylight game on the Steam platform. The script uses the Steam review API and saves the collected reviews in a CSV file for further processing.

## Preprocessing and Data Cleaning

## Data Analysis and Application of NLP Techniques
